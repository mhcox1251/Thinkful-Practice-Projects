1) Write a query that allows you to inspect the schema of the naep table. - Incorrect. In this query you will actually want to query a system table that exists that holds the column and table information about the table naep itselg. The idea is to not SELECT the data from the naep table. This system table can be found in the SQL checkpoints.


SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'naep';

SELECT *
FROM naep
LIMIT 50;

Write a query that returns summary statistics for avg_math_4_score by state, and sort the results alphabetically by state name. - You've included all the correct columns that need to be queried and more. Since you've already included the correct columns I will include the ones you need to keep and please remove the others. Also, ROUND() is not necessary on these columns. Keep this columns: state, COUNT(*), AVG(avg_math_4_score), MIN(avg_math_4_score), MAX(avg_math_4_score) - this is the same on problem 4.

SELECT state, COUNT(*), AVG(avg_math_4_score) AS Average, MIN(avg_math_4_score) AS Minimum, MAX(avg_math_4_score) AS Maximum
FROM naep
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY state;

--4

SELECT state, COUNT(avg_math_4_score), ROUND(AVG(avg_math_4_score),2) AS Average, ROUND(SUM(avg_math_4_score), 2) AS Sum, ROUND(MIN(avg_math_4_score),2) AS Minimum, MAX(avg_math_4_score) AS Maximum
FROM naep
GROUP BY state
HAVING MAX(avg_math_4_score)-MIN(avg_math_4_score) > 30
ORDER BY state;

SELECT state AS bottom_10_states
FROM naep
WHERE year = 2000
ORDER BY avg_math_4_score ASC
LIMIT 10;

SELECT ROUND(AVG(avg_math_4_score), 2)
FROM naep
WHERE year = 2000;

SELECT state AS below_average_states_y2000
FROM naep
WHERE avg_math_4_score < 
		(SELECT AVG(avg_math_4_score)
		 FROM naep
		WHERE year = 2000);

--8.

SELECT state AS scores_missing_y2000, avg_math_4_score
FROM naep
WHERE year = 2000 AND avg_math_4_score IS NULL;

--9.

SELECT naep.state, ROUND(avg_math_4_score, 2), total_expenditure
FROM naep LEFT OUTER JOIN finance
ON naep.id = finance.id
WHERE naep.year = 2000 AND avg_math_4_score IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY total_expenditure DESC;
